                            <li>All non-essential retail stores are ordered to close.</li>

                            <li>Beaches, Parks and the Malibu Pier and the pier's restaurants and shops are all closed to prevent crowding amidst the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic to help slow spread of the virus & protect vulnerable groups.</li>
